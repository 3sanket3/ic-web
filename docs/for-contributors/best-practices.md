# Best Practices

The code in this project follows certain best practices. Please try to learn and follow them, it makes the job of other developers on the team easier.

## File Naming Best Practices

* All files (and folders) are named in `kebab-case` format. The format is pretty straight forward; every letter should be in lowercase and the words should only be separated by the letter hyphen ("-").
* Files like `CNAME`, `README.md` and other such standard files are exceptions to the above rule.
